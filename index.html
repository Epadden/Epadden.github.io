			<h4>About Margie Engle</h4>
		</div>
			Engle has over 200 Grand Prix wins under her belt, has been named AGA Rider of the Year 10 times, has been on more than 20 winning
 Nations Cup teams, and was the 1991 AHSA Equestrian of the Year.
In 1992, Engle was named the Rolex/National Grand Prix League Rider of the Year, a feat she repeated in 1993. In 1999, Engle rode
 Hidden Creek’s Alvaretto to the Team Silver medal at the Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney,
 Australia, she was the highest-placed woman and the highest-placed U.S. rider in the individual competition riding Hidden Creek’s Perin to a 10th-place tie.
Engle suffered a broken hip when a horse fell on her in 2004. Just three months later, riding her Olympic mount Hidden Creek’s Perin, Engle beat a field of 26 entries that included 
eight Olympians, to win the Cosequin Invitational Grand Prix at the 
Cosequin U.S. Grand Prix League Invitational Finals in Culpeper, Va. In 2006 she led the World Cup standings all year.
She was a part of the U.S. Silver medal team at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games aboard Hidden Creek’s Quervo Gold.
In 2010, Engle and Indigo jumped to top placings at competitions throughout the United States. In April, they won the
 Grand Prix of Tampa which served as an FEI World Cup Qualifier. They then traveled to New York in the summer and 
topped the field in the Hermès Grand Prix in Lake Placid and the HITS-on-the-Hudson V Grand Prix. The pair finished 
their strong 2010 season by winning the World Cup Qualifier of Syracuse.
 Aboard Indigo, Engle was a co-recipient of the 2012 USEF National Show Jumping Championship title with the help of a clear
 round in the first trial. This win allowed Engle to claim her third national title, finish second in the USEF 
Selection Trials for the U.S. Show Jumping Team, and be named to the USEF Long List for the U.S. Show Jumping 
Team for the 2012 London Olympic Games.
